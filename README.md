### Problem Statement:

Develop a simple web app to search music and create playlist, similar to Spotify

### Description:

You need to create a small web app to let the user search for music and create playlist and add music to favourite. You can directly use the API mentioned below, no need to rest API. This app will also require the user for authentication by Keycloak

### Minimum Requirements:

   - _Home_ : Show the list of user playlist and user favourites music
   - _Search_ : Type keyword to search music & Auto search complete

### Must have:

1. Single Page Application.
2. Clean & fluidic layout – use bootstrap (5.0) only.

4. Let me stress the previous point - Readable, Simple & Clean code.
5. Minimum third-party dependencies.
6. Code must be written in TypeScript only, no JS code will be accepted.

#### Bonus Points:

1. User could retain the saved list even after closing the browser.

You can use local storage to save the user preferences.
